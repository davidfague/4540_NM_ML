Project 1:

  You can run the EEG_eyes_open__closed_alpha_waves.ipynb notebook in Google Colab rightaway.
  
  Alternatively, you may create your own conda environment and run the notebook on your local machine.
  
  The txt document has data from EEG recordings while a patient opens and closes their eyes. The goal notebook of the notebook is to train a model to classify whether or not the person's eyes are open based on the EEG data.
  
  When a person's eyes are open, neural activity from visual stimuli should be present, and not present when the person's eyes are closed. Because EEG is a recording of the culmination of neural activity, a ML aglorithm should be able to detect an increase/decrease in activity associated with the visual stimuli and classify whether or not the eyes are open.
